 * \brief Convert tagged bit stream to packed byte stream
 *
 * Block for packing bits into bytes, aligned to a stream tag. This block is generally
 * used after a block like Correlate Access Code Tag, where a preamble is tagged in a
 * stream of bits and you want to pack those bits into bytes starting at that tagged
 * sample.
 *
 * The typical formatting behavior is to pack bits MSB first.  The first
 * bit received is placed into bit 8, the second into bit position 7 and so
 * on.  Little endian formatting allows data to be packed LSB first, i.e the
 * first bit received is put into position 0, the next into position 1 and
 * so on.
 *
 * Example:
 * A bit stream has the third element tagged.
 * __Tag
 * 1010100101
 *
 * The Tag Bits Pack block (in drop stub mode) will output one byte, with the tag.
 * __Tag
 * 0xA5
 *
 * The Tag Bits Pack block in pad right mode will output two bytes, with the tag.
 * ________Tag
 * 0x02,0xA5
 *
 *
 * Time is also added to the byte sample, ralative to the sample rate.
 *
 * Stub Modes:
 *   Drop Stubs: drop the bits that don't fit into a byte before a tag
 *   Pad Right: fill in missing bits to the right
 *   Pad Left: fill in missing bits to the left
 *
 * Input: Bits with tags
 * Output: Bytes
