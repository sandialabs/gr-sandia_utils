 * This block internally buffers the specified number of samples. It
 * watches for rx_time tags, which indicate overflow, sample rate change,
 * or frequency changes from the source.
 *
 * A BLOCK tag is output with the first sample of each block. The value of
 * the tag is the number of samples which have been skipped since the last
 * block (not counting any skips from source overflows).
 *
 * An example use case would be to place this block immediately after a
 * source, proceeded by a throttle. Then, the source can be set to a high
 * sample rate, while the processing is done at a lower, configurable rate.
 * Only connect one block to the output of this block as odd behavior has
 * been observed with multiple connected blocks due to the scheduler.
